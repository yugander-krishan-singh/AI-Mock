# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Sample prompts

#### ORC Select items page

```
You have to give me an HTML code. Before and after html code add string \"YUGI\" indicating start and end. The html should be able to create a page with Heading "Return Items" aligned in center. This will be referenced as MainHeading in prompt.  Below the MainHeading add a subheading with text "Select Items" aligned left. The size of subheading should be 3 level less than main heading and text style should be a normal. Below the subheading create a box with visible boundary and flex layout, with some vertical center, with some padding which should have image placeholder on left side and on right side it should have the name of image as "ASICS Men's Jolt 2 Black/White Running Shoes". Add one more entry about shirt in similar style to shoe below shoe entry. Each card should have checkbox to select which should be first item  in the card. Add a button named "Submit" below all cards with some spacing at top. Also remove all \n characters from output  \n\n. Remove all "" from the output. Also ignore all the spelling mistakes.
